# AQI-Catalonia-Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to analyze the evolution of air pollution in Catalunya over time and use this information to build an algorithm that forecast the concentration of one pollutant in 2 timescale variants:

    Monthly pollutant concentration for the next 2 years.
    Hourly concentration from February 15 to 28.

The Hourly data for pollutants comes from the automatic measurement points of the Air Pollution
Monitoring and Forecasting Network in Catalunya from 1991 until 2023. This data is hosted in the
ocean protocol network as a [data asset](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:4e5040015fd68a5ea61d18c471f164ab531dc6828dde4710d0cdfcdffa62761e)
